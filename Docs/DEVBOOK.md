## Technical Decisions

### Core Architecture
- PowerShell 5.1 and Core compatibility
- Microsoft.Dism.PowerShell module usage
- Modular design pattern
- Private functions for common operations:
  - `Test-AdminPrivilege`: Validation des privilèges administrateur
  - `New-TemporaryMount`: Création de points de montage temporaires
  - `Remove-TemporaryMount`: Nettoyage des points de montage temporaires
  - `Format-FileSize`: Formatage des tailles de fichiers

### Testing Strategy
- Pester testing framework
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for image operations
- Mocked catalog operations
- Separate test suites for public and private functions

### Documentation
- Comment-based help
- Markdown documentation
- Example scripts
- User guide

## Current Focus
